                Much of the tooling used for infrastructure automation still consists of page after page of shell scripts.
                Our operations tools deserve the same level of care, quality and portability as the software we deliver!

                What if, instead of building our ops tooling as scripts, we were to build them as services? With great golang
                features like cross-platform (and architecture) compilation, static linking, docker client api's and more
                - nothing is holding us back.

                During this session, we'll be looking at some aspects of why golang is so awesome for doing devops work.
